\subsection{Trial Period Definition}
\label{subsec:trial-definition}

The Parties agree to a \defterm{Trial Period} consisting of the first \textbf{eight (8)}
completed jobs under this Agreement.

\subsubsection{Completed Job Definition}
For purposes of this Section, a \defterm{Completed Job} means a roofing project for which:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An insurance supplement claim has been prepared and submitted to the insurance carrier;
    \item The insurance carrier has approved the supplement claim (in whole or in part);
    \item The Company has received payment from the insurance carrier for the approved supplement;
    \item The Specialist has been paid their share in accordance with Section~\ref{sec:compensation}.
\end{enumerate}

A job shall be counted toward the Trial Period only when all four criteria above have been satisfied.

\subsubsection{Trial Period Compensation}
During the Trial Period (Jobs 1 through 8), compensation shall be calculated according to
the revenue splits defined in Section~\ref{sec:compensation}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Regular claims (below \$10,000): 70\% Specialist / 30\% Company
    \item Big Supplements (\$10,000 or more): 50\% Specialist / 50\% Company
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Post-Trial Period Adjustment}
\label{subsec:post-trial}

\subsubsection{Permanent Revenue Split Change}
Upon successful completion of the Trial Period (after the eighth Completed Job),
the compensation structure shall automatically and permanently adjust as follows:

\textbf{All supplement claims, regardless of amount, shall be split equally:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Specialist:} \percentage{50} (fifty percent)
    \item \textbf{Company:} \percentage{50} (fifty percent)
\end{itemize}

This equal 50/50 revenue split shall apply to all jobs beginning with the ninth
Completed Job and all subsequent jobs for the duration of this Agreement.

\subsubsection{Effective Date of Adjustment}
The Post-Trial revenue split shall become effective immediately upon payment to the
Specialist for the eighth Completed Job. The ninth Completed Job and all jobs thereafter
shall be compensated at the 50/50 rate, regardless of the supplement amount.

\subsubsection{Permanence of Adjustment}
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Post-Trial 50/50 revenue split is intended
to be permanent and shall remain in effect for the duration of this Agreement unless
the Parties execute a written amendment to this Agreement.

\subsection{Trial Period Tracking and Notification}
\label{subsec:trial-tracking}

\subsubsection{Job Count Documentation}
The Company shall maintain accurate records of the number of Completed Jobs under this
Agreement and shall provide the Specialist with written notification when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The fourth Completed Job has been paid (50\% progress notification);
    \item The seventh Completed Job has been paid (approaching end of Trial Period);
    \item The eighth Completed Job has been paid (Trial Period complete, 50/50 split now effective).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Mutual Agreement on Job Count}
If there is any dispute regarding whether a job qualifies as a Completed Job or the

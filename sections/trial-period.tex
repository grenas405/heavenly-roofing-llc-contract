\section{Trial Period and Progressive Partnership}
\label{sec:trial-period}

\subsection{Trial Period Definition}
\label{subsec:trial-definition}

The Parties agree to a \defterm{Trial Period} consisting of the first \textbf{eight (8)}
completed jobs under this Agreement.

\subsubsection{Completed Job Definition}
For purposes of this Section, a \defterm{Completed Job} means a roofing project for which:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An insurance supplement claim has been prepared and submitted to the insurance carrier;
    \item The insurance carrier has approved the supplement claim (in whole or in part);
    \item The Company has received payment from the insurance carrier for the approved supplement;
    \item The Specialist has been paid their share in accordance with Section~\ref{sec:compensation}.
\end{enumerate}

A job shall be counted toward the Trial Period only when all four criteria above have been satisfied.

\subsubsection{Trial Period Compensation}
During the Trial Period (Jobs 1 through 8), compensation shall be calculated according to
the revenue split defined in Section~\ref{sec:compensation}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All supplement claims: 70\% Specialist / 30\% Company
\end{itemize}

This is the same split that applies after the Trial Period, as detailed in
Section~\ref{subsec:post-trial}.

\subsection{Post-Trial Period Continuation}
\label{subsec:post-trial}

\subsubsection{Revenue Split Consistency}
Upon successful completion of the Trial Period (after the eighth Completed Job),
the compensation structure shall continue unchanged:

\textbf{All supplement claims continue with the same split:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Specialist:} \percentage{70} (seventy percent)
    \item \textbf{Company:} \percentage{30} (thirty percent)
\end{itemize}

This revenue split remains in effect for all jobs beginning with the ninth Completed Job
and all subsequent jobs for the duration of this Agreement.

\subsubsection{Trial Period Completion Milestone}
The completion of the Trial Period represents a significant business milestone and marks
the transition from an evaluation phase to an established business relationship. Upon
completion of the eighth Completed Job:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The termination notice period increases from 7 days to 30 days as specified
          in Section~\ref{subsec:trial-performance};
    \item Training obligations transition from structured monthly sessions to as-needed
          support as described in Section~\ref{sec:knowledge-exchange};
    \item The business relationship is considered established and mature.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Effective Date of Transition}
The Post-Trial period shall become effective immediately upon payment to the Specialist
for the eighth Completed Job. The provisions above regarding termination notice and
training schedule shall apply to all activities following this milestone.

\subsection{Trial Period Tracking and Notification}
\label{subsec:trial-tracking}

\subsubsection{Job Count Documentation}
The Company shall maintain accurate records of the number of Completed Jobs under this
Agreement and shall provide the Specialist with written notification when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The fourth Completed Job has been paid (50\% progress notification);
    \item The seventh Completed Job has been paid (approaching end of Trial Period);
    \item The eighth Completed Job has been paid (Trial Period complete, 50/50 split now effective).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Mutual Agreement on Job Count}
If there is any dispute regarding whether a job qualifies as a Completed Job or the
total count of Completed Jobs, the Parties shall discuss in good faith and mutually
agree on the count. If the Parties cannot agree, the dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with Section~\ref{sec:dispute}.

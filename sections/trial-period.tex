\section{Trial Period and Progressive Partnership}
\label{sec:trial-period}

\subsection{Trial Period Definition}
\label{subsec:trial-definition}

The Parties agree to a \defterm{Trial Period} consisting of the first \textbf{eight (8)}
completed jobs under this Agreement.

\subsubsection{Completed Job Definition}
For purposes of this Section, a \defterm{Completed Job} means a roofing project for which:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An initial insurance claim has been processed and submitted to the insurance carrier by the Specialist;
    \item The insurance carrier has approved the initial claim (in whole or in part);
    \item The Company has received payment from the insurance carrier for the approved initial claim;
    \item The Specialist has been paid their share in accordance with Section~\ref{sec:compensation}.
\end{enumerate}

A job shall be counted toward the Trial Period only when all four criteria above have been satisfied.
Insurance supplements prepared by the Company after the initial claim do not affect the job count.

\subsubsection{Trial Period Compensation}
During the Trial Period (Jobs 1 through 8), compensation shall be calculated according to
the revenue split defined in Section~\ref{sec:compensation}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial insurance claims: 70\% Specialist / 30\% Company
    \item Insurance supplements: 100\% Company
\end{itemize}

The Specialist receives 70\% of Initial Insurance Claim Amounts during the Trial Period,
while the Company retains all supplement revenue.

\subsection{Post-Trial Period Continuation}
\label{subsec:post-trial}

\subsubsection{Revenue Split Transition to 50/50}
Upon successful completion of the Trial Period (after the eighth Completed Job),
the compensation structure shall transition to an equal revenue split:

\textbf{Initial insurance claims transition to equal split:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Specialist:} \percentage{50} (fifty percent)
    \item \textbf{Company:} \percentage{50} (fifty percent)
    \item \textbf{Supplements:} \percentage{100} Company (one hundred percent)
\end{itemize}

This 50/50 revenue split for initial claims remains in effect for all jobs beginning with
the ninth Completed Job and all subsequent jobs for the duration of this Agreement. The
Company continues to retain 100\% of all supplement revenue.

\subsubsection{Trial Period Completion Milestone}
The completion of the Trial Period represents a significant business milestone and marks
the transition from an evaluation phase to an established business relationship. Upon
completion of the eighth Completed Job:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The termination notice period increases from 7 days to 30 days as specified
          in Section~\ref{subsec:trial-performance};
    \item Training obligations transition from structured monthly sessions to as-needed
          support as described in Section~\ref{sec:knowledge-exchange};
    \item The business relationship is considered established and mature.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Effective Date of Transition}
The Post-Trial period shall become effective immediately upon payment to the Specialist
for the eighth Completed Job. The provisions above regarding termination notice and
training schedule shall apply to all activities following this milestone.

\subsection{Trial Period Tracking and Notification}
\label{subsec:trial-tracking}

\subsubsection{Job Count Documentation}
The Company shall maintain accurate records of the number of Completed Jobs under this
Agreement and shall provide the Specialist with written notification when:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The fourth Completed Job has been paid (50\% progress notification);
    \item The seventh Completed Job has been paid (approaching end of Trial Period);
    \item The eighth Completed Job has been paid (Trial Period complete, 50/50 split now effective for initial claims).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Mutual Agreement on Job Count}
If there is any dispute regarding whether a job qualifies as a Completed Job or the
total count of Completed Jobs, the Parties shall discuss in good faith and mutually
agree on the count. If the Parties cannot agree, the dispute shall be resolved in
